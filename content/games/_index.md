I started learning Game Development as a way to have fun and create software which can be enjoyed by most people. 
I'm currently using [Pico8](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/) Game Engine for development, it allows you to create small retro games which can be even played within browser.
However, picking Pico8 was just a way to get started with game development.
My final goal is to start developing using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) Engine, which allows you to create much bigger and more complex games. 
You can check them out below, I'll try to keep them posted below. Thanks!
