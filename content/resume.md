<b style="color:#bef264">Platform Migration System</b>: 
Developed system to automate migration of clients from old platform to new platform post acquisition. 
The setup was automated through UI which allowed to pick specific users and their assets required for migration while having
option to just move the data one time (mainly for demo purpose) or keep it in sync between the two platforms.
The system was designed to ingest upto 10GB data per day but could be scaled up horizontally to achieve higher limits.
